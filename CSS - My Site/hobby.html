      </div>
        <p>
          I love photography for all types of genre, however, my preference is landscape or no person is involved.
          I do love also portraiture photography and macro. I'd like to see the bigger side of an insect, that is. I
          joined photography groups to gain more insights and knowledge about photography techniques such lighting,
          editing and compositing.

        <h2>Sports</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        I love outdoor sports especially lawn tennis.  I played most sports when I was a kid such as volleyball,
        basketball, softballs or baseball during my elementary and high school days.

      </p>

      <h3>Tennis</h3>

      <p>Tennis has been my passion in sports. I used to play tennis almost everyday for the past years. I used
        to be a ball-boy when I was a little kid in my home-town where the players have to pay P.25 cents per
        game. When my parents moved to another place, I forgot also Tennis until I found it later when I started
        working abroad in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Then it went on and off until we moved here in the United Arab Emirates.
        Here, I found my first love in sports until now.
      </p>

      <h3>Swimming</h3>
      <p>Swimming is my alternative past-time. I am not a professional swimmer but I can swim and I love Swimming
      in an open sea or swimming pool.</p>

        <h2>Digital Games</h2>

      </div>
      <p>
      I am a computer geek who loves coding and computer games. I played a lot during my spare time in word games such as Scrabble, my all
      time favorite and Scramble. One thing I always played on my phone is Scrabble and Candy Crush.

        <h2>Cooking</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        There's a saying that if you love eating, you must now cooking at the same time. True. I love cooking
        different types of food whether it is high-end type of food but my favorite is Filipino and some International type of foods.
      </p>
        <h3>Traditional Filipino Cuisine</h3>
        <p>I love Filipino foods. Of course I am a Filipino by blood. I love cooking from the very basic Adobo type to
          different kinds of menu. I used to experiment also the ingredients to make it so different from
          the traditional way of cooking.
        </p>

        <h3>Baking</h3>
        <p>I just discovered lately that I have an innert talent of baking. By just watching YouTube channel, I learned the
        the way how to bake different types of bread and delicacies.
