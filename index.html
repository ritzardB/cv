      <h2>- My Profile -</h2>
      <p>Good day! My name is Richard S. Balabarcon, a newbie IOS application and Web Developer.</p>
      <p>Though, I used to be a computer programmer way back then but I landed a different job out of my profession for more than 20 years!</p>
      <p>I realized that my programming skills are still in my blood streams, therefore, I am back to learning from scratch.</p>
      <p>It is used to be like that you'll be back to your first love</p>
      <p>And, here I am struggling new things and soon enough, I will be a <span style="color: red">pro!</span></p>
      <p>I've been working in the corporate world for more than 20 years as Administrator and become an Human Resource Specialist.</p>
      <p>Right now, I am building an empire as Mobile Apps and Website Developer.</p>
      <p>I would say, this is my passion or calling as a matter of fact, since I never practice programming for such a long time but then I still find ways to go back what I have become.</p>
      <p>This is great experience and I am counting.</p>
